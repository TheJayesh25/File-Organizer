🚀 Automate the Small, Win the Big

Amidst my daily job, I recently found myself stuck with a simple yet annoying problem — organizing a messy folder filled with random files.

Instead of manually sorting them — a time-consuming task we’ve all been guilty of — I decided to take a quick detour and build a Python File Organizer.

Here’s what this small but mighty script does:

 ✅ Scans a folder and identifies file types (Images, Documents, Videos, Music, Archives, Applications)
 ✅ Creates folders automatically (if they don’t already exist)
 ✅ Moves files to their respective categories — no more drag-and-drop

✨ Why does this matter?
Because not every problem needs a grand solution. Sometimes, it’s the simple automations that save us hours over time.
Beyond saving clicks and frustration, this project also gave me a quick coding refresher — working with:

 ✔️ Python fundamentals (file handling, loops, dictionaries)
 ✔️ Automation logic
 ✔️ Real-world problem-solving


The takeaway? You don’t always have to build complex systems — solving small, everyday inefficiencies is just as impactful.
